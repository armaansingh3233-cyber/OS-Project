# OS-Project
Interactive OS resource allocation simulator
# 🖥️ Adaptive Resource Allocation System

An interactive, real-time OS process simulator dashboard that demonstrates dynamic resource management and system monitoring in multiprogramming environments.

## Features

### Core Monitoring
- **Real-time CPU & Memory Tracking** - Live visualization of system resource usage
- **Process Management** - Add, kill, and monitor individual processes
- **Thermal Monitoring** - Temperature tracking based on system load (45-90°C)
- **System Uptime** - Track how long the system has been running

### Advanced Features
- **System Overload Detection** - Visual alerts at 60%, 75%, and 90% load thresholds
- **Auto-Kill Functionality** - Automatically terminate top resource consumers during critical overload (>90%)
- **Bottleneck Analysis** - Identifies CPU and memory bottlenecks with recommendations
- **Process Priority System** - High, Medium, Low priority process classification
- **Resource Aggregation** - View CPU/Memory metrics using Sum, Average, or Max calculations

### Visualization
- **Real-time Charts** - Line chart showing CPU/Memory usage over time
- **Process Distribution** - Pie charts for CPU and memory distribution by process
- **Process Table** - Detailed table with sortable columns (CPU, Memory)
- **Status Indicators** - Color-coded alerts for system health
